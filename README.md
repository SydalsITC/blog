# "Let there be byte!"

Hi. I'm a Linux and IoT fan, currently working on cloud projects with Kubernetes and Helm. Some bits and bytes of my projects might be usefull for some of you, so I'm trying to publish some small projects from time to time, collecting them in this repo which I use as a kind of blog.

Make your life easier with some aliases and functions in your bashrc or bash_aliasess file (depending on your distribution). You'll find some handy examples in [k8s-cheatsheet.md](k8s-cheatsheet.md).
